# Shiny-Docker-Server

This repository contains a build script to install and run a docker image (also located here) that will create and configure an r shiny and rstudio server to host various r shiny apps on an ec2 instance. To host more/ different apps, simply modify the apps pulled by the script and install any additional packages needed by modifying the dockerfile.
